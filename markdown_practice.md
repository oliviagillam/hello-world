<br/> <-- this will start a new line

This will format it like python code:
```python
  num = input("What is your favorite number?")
  print("You entered", num)
  my_num = 2*int(num)
  print("Mine", my_num*2)
  ```
  
  This will just make it like block text:
 ```
  num = input("What is your favorite number?")
  print("You entered", num)
  my_num = 2*int(num)
  print("Mine", my_num*2)
  
  See?
  ```

  1. Item 1
1. Item 2

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
